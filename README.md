# LinkedInPostScraper
This repository contains a Python-based scraper that attaches to a running, manually logged-in Chromium-based browser (such as Microsoft Edge) via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) to scrape posts from a LinkedIn company page. The scraped posts are then saved as an Excel file for easy analysis.
